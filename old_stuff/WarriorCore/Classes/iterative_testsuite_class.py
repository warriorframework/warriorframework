Iterative testsuite:
An iterative suite is one where the  exectype="iterative_sequential" or "iterative_parallel".

- For an iterative suite it is mandatory to provide a value for <InputDataFile> in the details
section of the suite.

- All cases in the suite will use the <InputDataFile> provided in the details section of the
suite for execution i.e. the values of <InputDataFile> provided in for each case in the suite
or the value of <InputDataFile> provided in the case details will be overwritten with the value
of <InputDataFile> provided in the details section of the suite.

- In case of an iterative suite user will not be able to provide an input datafile to each
testcase in the suite. If using katana the option will not be available to the user, if user
uses an xml editor ad provides a value for <input_data_file> for a case in the suite then this
value will be ignored.

- If the suite is of exectype=iterative_parallel or iterative_sequential then all the testcases
in the suite should have datatype=Iterative and not custom. If any testcase in an iterative
suite has datatype=custom then the testcase execution will be skipped.

iterative_sequential:
If the suite exectype="iterative_sequential" then the cases in the suite will be executed against
each system in the <InputDataFile> in a sequential fashion.

For Eg:
Suite-1 has exectype="iterative_sequential", <InputDataFile> provided in the suite details has 2
systems say sys-1, sys-2. Suite-1 has three cases say case-1, case-2, case-3.

For the eg the execution would be as follows.
1. case-1 will be executed on sys-1 then,
2. case-2 will be executed on sys-1 then,
3. case-3 will be executed on sys-1 then,
4. case-1 will be executed on sys-2 then,
5. case-2 will be executed on sys-2 then,
6. case-3 will be executed on sys-2.

iterative_parallel:
If the suite exectype="iterative_parallel" then the cases in the suite will be executed against
each system in the <InputDataFile> in a parallel fashion.

For Eg:
Suite-1 has exectype="iterative_parallel", <InputDataFile> provided in the suite details has 2
systems say sys-1, sys-2. Suite-1 has three cases say case-1, case-2, case-3.

For the eg the execution would be as follows.
case-1, case-2, case-3  will be executed on sys-1 sequentially,
at the same time case-1, case-2, case-3  will be executed on sys-2 sequentially.
So the case executions will take place in parallel on all the systems at the same time.
