    add src and dst tag to copy the dir tree at src location to the dst location with out
    copying all the other data
    you can also specify multiple sources and destinations. Each of the source tag should
    begin with "src" and the corresponding destination should begin with "dst" with the 
    same remaining letters like
    src1 - dst1, srca - dsta, srcxyz - dstxyz
    if src and dst are not given, all the contents of the repository would be copied to warrior/repos
    if src alone is mentioned, the src would be copied to warrior/repos
