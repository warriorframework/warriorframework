        wants to clone Warrior and will clone Warrior afresh. Setting this to
        'no', or leaving it empty would not delete the existing Warrior.

        repository will be cloned if the all_drivers attribute is either set
        to "" or if it is not present.

        *  If no drivers are mentioned under the repository tag and if the clone
        attribute is explicitly set to "no", only then, nothing would be
        cloned. all_drivers attribute is disregarded at that point
