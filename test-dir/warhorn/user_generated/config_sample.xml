        wants to clone Warrior and will clone Warrior afresh. Setting this to
        'no', or leaving it empty would not delete the existing Warrior.

        ** clone: Can be set to 'yes' or 'no' or can be left empty. Leaving
        this attribute value empty would be considered a default yes. Until

        ** label: This is an attribute can be set to reflect the name of the

        ** all_drivers: If the user wants to clone all the drivers in the
        repository, s/he can set this tag to 'yes'.

        *  If driver tags are created under the repository tag, only the
        specified drivers will be cloned, provided that the all_drivers tag
        is not present, set to "", or set to "no"

        *  If the all_drivers attribute is set to "yes", everything in the
        corresponding repository WILL BE cloned and any drivers mentioned
        under the repository tag would be disregarded.

        *  If no drivers are specified under the repository tag, the entire
        repository will be cloned if the all_drivers attribute is either set
        to "" or if it is not present.

        *  If no drivers are mentioned under the repository tag and if the clone
        attribute is explicitly set to "no", only then, nothing would be
        cloned. all_drivers attribute is disregarded at that point

         -driver tag-

        that the user wants to clone.
