================================================

1. Clone Katana

	$cd warriorframework
	$cd katana

3. To check the list of versions available, execute "git tag --list" command

	$ git branch
	* master

not a stable tested version.


4. To switch to a specific version from master, execute 'git checkout <version_name>' command.
	$ git checkout 1.0
	Note: checking out '1.0'.
	
	You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
	changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
	state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
	
	If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
	do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:
	
	  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
