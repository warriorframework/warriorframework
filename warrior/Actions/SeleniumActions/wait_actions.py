            USING LOCATOR_TYPE, LOCATOR, ELEMENT_CONFIG_FILE, AND ELEMENT_TAG
            =================================================================

            None of these arguments are mandatory BUT to search an element,
            you need to provide Warrior with some way to do it.

            a. You can either directly give values for the locator_type and
            locator. So if locator_type = name and locator = navigation-bar,
            then Warrior can search for an element with name "navigation-bar"

            b. You can give location of the element_config_file and a tag
            inside it so that Warrior can search for that tag and get the
            required information from there.

            - Now, if the locator type is given, Warrior
            will search for that locator_type in the children of that element
            in the element_config_file

            - You can also set defaults in the element_config_file, and now,
            even if the locator_type is not given, Warrior will know which
            element to find. If locator_type is given, the default will be
            overridden

            - If locator_type is not f=given, and the defaults are not
            specified, then the first element in the child list of the element
            tag would be picked.

            NOTES:
                For these four arguments to be given correctly, ONE of the
                following conditions must be satisfied.

                1. locator_type and locator must be given
                2. locator_type, element_config_file, and element_tag
                must be given
                3. element_config_file, and element_tag must be given

                The datafile has the first priority, then the json file, and
                then finally the testcase.

                If all arguments are passed from the same place, then, if
                locator and locator_type are given, then they would have
                priority. Otherwise, the element_config_file would be searched

                The locator_type locator, element_tag can be given the datafile
                as children of the <browser> tag, but these values would remain
                constant for that browser. It is recommended that these values
                be passed from the testcase step.

                The element_config_file typically would not change from step to
                step, so it can be passed from the data file

        :Arguments:

            1. system_name(str) = the system name.
            2. browser_name(str) = Unique name for this particular browser
            3. timeout(str) = amount of time the browser should wait
            4. locator_type(str) = type of the locator - xpath, id, etc.
            5. locator(str) = locator by which the element should be located.
            6. element_config_file(str) = location of the element config file
            7. element_tag(str) = json id of the locator that you want to use

            USING LOCATOR_TYPE, LOCATOR, ELEMENT_CONFIG_FILE, AND ELEMENT_TAG
            =================================================================

            None of these arguments are mandatory BUT to search an element,
            you need to provide Warrior with some way to do it.

            a. You can either directly give values for the locator_type and
            locator. So if locator_type = name and locator = navigation-bar,
            then Warrior can search for an element with name "navigation-bar"

            b. You can give location of the element_config_file and a tag
            inside it so that Warrior can search for that tag and get the
            required information from there.

            - Now, if the locator type is given, Warrior
            will search for that locator_type in the children of that element
            in the element_config_file

            - You can also set defaults in the element_config_file, and now,
            even if the locator_type is not given, Warrior will know which
            element to find. If locator_type is given, the default will be
            overridden

            - If locator_type is not f=given, and the defaults are not
            specified, then the first element in the child list of the element
            tag would be picked.

            NOTES:
                For these four arguments to be given correctly, ONE of the
                following conditions must be satisfied.

                1. locator_type and locator must be given
                2. locator_type, element_config_file, and element_tag
                must be given
                3. element_config_file, and element_tag must be given

                The datafile has the first priority, then the json file, and
                then finally the testcase.

                If all arguments are passed from the same place, then, if
                locator and locator_type are given, then they would have
                priority. Otherwise, the element_config_file would be searched

                The locator_type locator, element_tag can be given the datafile
                as children of the <browser> tag, but these values would remain
                constant for that browser. It is recommended that these values
                be passed from the testcase step.

                The element_config_file typically would not change from step to
                step, so it can be passed from the data file

                For these four arguments to be given correctly, ONE of the
                following conditions must be satisfied.

                1. locator_type and locator must be given
                2. locator_type, element_config_file, and element_tag
                must be given
                3. element_config_file, and element_tag must be given

                The datafile has the first priority, then the json file, and
                then finally the testcase.

                If all arguments are passed from the same place, then, if
                locator and locator_type are given, then they would have
                priority. Otherwise, the element_config_file would be searched

                The locator_type locator, element_tag can be given the datafile
                as children of the <browser> tag, but these values would remain
                constant for that browser. It is recommended that these values
                be passed from the testcase step.

                The element_config_file typically would not change from step to
                step, so it can be passed from the data file

        :Arguments:

            1. system_name(str) = the system name.
            2. browser_name(str) = Unique name for this particular browser

            4. locator_type(str) = type of the locator - xpath, id, etc.

            Tags or attributes to be used in input datafile for the system or
            subsystem. If both tag and attribute is provided the attribute will
            be used.

                             a <system> tag directly under the <credentials>
                             tag. An attribute "name" has to be added to this
                             tag and the value of that attribute would be taken
                             in as value to this keyword attribute.

                              instance should have a unique name. This name can
                              be added here

                              Eg: <browser_name>Unique_name_1</browser_name>

            3. timeout = This contains the information of how much time the
                         browser needs to wait for an element whose existence
                         in the DOM is unknown to become visible

                         Eg: <timeout>15</timeout>

            4. locator_type = This contains information about the type of
                              locator that you want to use. Can be 'xpath',

            USING LOCATOR_TYPE, LOCATOR, ELEMENT_CONFIG_FILE, AND ELEMENT_TAG
            =================================================================

            None of these arguments are mandatory BUT to search an element,
            you need to provide Warrior with some way to do it.

            a. You can either directly give values for the locator_type and
            locator. So if locator_type = name and locator = navigation-bar,
            then Warrior can search for an element with name "navigation-bar"

            b. You can give location of the element_config_file and a tag
            inside it so that Warrior can search for that tag and get
            the required information from there.

            - Now, if the locator type is given, Warrior
            will search for that locator_type in the children of that element
            in the element_config_file

            - You can also set defaults in the element_config_file, and now,
            even if the locator_type is not given, Warrior will know which
            element to find. If locator_type is given, the default will be
            overridden

            - If locator_type is not f=given, and the defaults are not
            specified, then the first element in the child list of the element
            tag would be picked.

            NOTES:
                For these four arguments to be given correctly, ONE of the
                following conditions must be satisfied.

                1. locator_type and locator must be given

                locator and locator_type are given, then they would have
